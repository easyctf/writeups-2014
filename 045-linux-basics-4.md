# 45 - Linux Basics 4 (TODO)

*Written by Michael Zhang*

## Problem

Alright time to get to some fun stuff: binaries. A **binary** is just a really fancy word that means a file (or in this case, a program) that contains some bits that are not text.

The binary in this problem is a program. When you run it, it'll ask you for an input, but not just any input: a special character. To run this binary, navigate to the folder `/problems/pipe` and run `./pipe`.

The source code is available for download [here](pipe.c), or you can find it at `/problems/pipe/pipe.c` on the shell server. The flag has been redacted.

## Hint

A pipe can refer to a number of things, but the one you are probably most concerned about is this `|` symbol.
