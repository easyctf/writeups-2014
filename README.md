# EasyCTF Writeups

*someone write some really inspiring stuff here*

Thanks for playing EasyCTF! Here are the solutions to the problems. If you have something to add, feel free to make a pull request to https://github.com/failedxyz/easyctf_writeups.

## Reflection

Our purpose in making this CTF was to help people learn programming and about systems in general. Consequently, after some processing, we'll leave the problems and site up after the contest.

We really enjoyed running this CTF and we hope you really enjoyed playing it. There will be more high school CTFs coming up, so you better be there :).
